# 310-Final-Project

This is an extension of Unity Technology's ML Dodgeball tutorial, found here https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents-dodgeball-env.

Our additions:

Agents are now reinforced positively for throwing dodgeballs and are negatively reinforced for falling into lava.

Environmentally, purple team now starts on a raised castle-like structure and a lava moat with a bridge divides the playing field.

Additionally, moving cover and platforms have been added in an attempt to see if agents take advantage of the routes and strategic
cover opened up by by these platforms.
